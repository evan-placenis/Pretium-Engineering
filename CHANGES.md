# Report Generation UI Redesign

## Summary of Changes

We've completely redesigned the report generation workflow to better match your requirements:

1. **Full-Screen Bullet Points Entry**

   - The initial page now shows a full-screen text area for entering bullet points
   - After generating a report, you're automatically directed to the editor page

2. **Microsoft Word-like Editor**

   - The report editor has a Word-like interface with blue navigation bar
   - Document is displayed with proper page formatting (8.5x11 page)
   - Times New Roman font with proper document styling

3. **Side Chat Interface**
   - Chat panel on the right side that can be toggled on/off
   - AI assistant can help with report modifications
   - Messages are saved in the database for future reference

## Required Database Setup

Before using the new features, you need to create two new tables in your Supabase database:

1. **chat_messages** - For storing chat conversations about reports
2. **training_documents** (optional) - For storing examples to guide the report generation

SQL scripts for creating these tables are available in the `sql/` directory.

## How to Use

1. **Create a Building** (unchanged from previous version)
2. **Create a Report**:

   - Enter bullet points in the full-screen editor
   - Click "Generate Report" when ready
   - You'll be taken to the Word-like editor automatically

3. **Edit a Report**:
   - Use the main document area to directly edit text
   - Use the chat panel to ask for AI help with specific changes
   - Click "Save" to save your changes

## Technical Implementation

- The report generation now happens in one step instead of two
- Chat functionality uses the OpenAI API to provide helpful responses
- All changes maintain proper user authentication and permissions

## Known Issues

- The training_documents feature requires creating the table in Supabase
- If you don't want to create this table, you might see an error in the logs (but the app will still work)
